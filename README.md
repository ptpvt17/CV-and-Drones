## Project Description
CV and Drones is a cutting-edge project that combines computer vision (CV) techniques with drone technology to create innovative solutions for various applications. The project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to enable drones to autonomously navigate, detect objects, and perform complex tasks.

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Drones can navigate autonomously using computer vision algorithms.
- **Object Detection:** Real-time object detection using advanced machine learning models.
- **Path Planning:** Efficient path planning for obstacle avoidance and optimal route selection.
- **Data Collection:** High-resolution image and video capture for data collection and analysis.
- **Remote Control:** Remote control and monitoring capabilities through a user-friendly interface.
